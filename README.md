## Description

##### Michael Bishop's Recon Toolkit is coded via Python. It contains multiple options for entry level recon on a host network. I have developed this tool to be used inside workplaces for recon testing and entry level cybersecurity users. 

---
## How to Use

##### This tool currently has three options to use. 
##### 1. Find Devices on Current Subnet
##### 2. Scan Open Ports on Current Device
##### 3. Scan Open Ports on another device

##### Option 1. Allows you to discover devices that are currently on your subnet that you might not be aware about. Optimal utilisation will allow both the hostname and the IP address to appear. 
###### Please note: Certain enviroment will not resolve the hostname but the IP address will be available still
